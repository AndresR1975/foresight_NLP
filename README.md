In this project I analyzed eight different methods included in the publication “Futures Research Methodology-V3.0” edited by Jerome Glenn: “Futures Wheels”, “Wild Cards”, “Structural Analysis”, “Decision Modeling”, Simulation and Games” , “Genius Forecasting”, “Normative Forecasting” and “Heuristic Modeling”. Based on word frequency, text correlation, and bigrams, the result is a conceptualization of futures design as a research project.

Process:
1. Importing libraries and loading data
2. Creating the objects: corpus, DTM, tidy and tidy_idf
3. Calculating word and frequencies
4. Ploting based on founded tokens
5. N-gram analysis
